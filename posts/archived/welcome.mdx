title: Welcome to the Blog!
---

Hello future people. I decided to start a blog thanks to a couple influences whom I'd like to name:

**Anthony Colpo**, an independent researcher and health/fitness coach has a very interesting and entertaining blog at anthonycolpo.com

**Jordan B Peterson**, a professor and public intellectual figure who seriously sparked my interest in writing and learning new things.

Since the start of 2021, I've been frequently spending me time watching videos and reading articles and research on a variety of topics and felt that a blog would be an excellent place to write about, think about, and talk about what I've been learning and also help document what I've been spending so much time doing over the year.

I will be writing about the topics I am interested in, including: Nutrition, Exercise, Technology, and Psychology.

The posts will hopefully be interesting and engaging and tackle difficult questions that I am still trying to figure out myself. This means that I might take controversial positions and make mistakes, but the goal is to learn, not deceive or manipulate.

Anyways, that's the brief idea of what going to be going on here. I plan on making the posts a bit more entertaining although I might need a bit of practice translating humor into my writing but I'll give it my best shot.

So if you happen to be reading this, I sincerely thank you for your interest. And as clich√© as it sounds, I hope you learn something new, or at least enjoy yourself.

Until next time.

\- Anthony
